## Implementation Details

### Design Replication

**Reference:** https://booking.theflexliving.com/listings/70985  
**Specification:** `.github/Page-Source/details.html`

#### ✅ Header (Exact Match)
- White background
- Flex Living logo/branding
- Navigation: Flex Living · All listings · About Us · Contact us
- Sticky positioning
- Flex Living brand color: `rgb(22, 79, 76)`

#### ✅ Image Gallery Section
- 5-image grid layout
- Main image (left) + 4 smaller images grid (right)
- Badges overlay:
  - Top left: "All Listings" (red badge `rgb(204, 31, 31)`)
  - Top right: Star rating (Flex Living green `rgb(22, 79, 76)`)
- Bottom right: "+ 40 photos" badge
- Responsive: 4-image grid hidden on mobile

#### ✅ Two-Column Layout
**Left Column (2/3 width):**
1. Property title & details
   - Property name
   - Apartment type, guest capacity, bedrooms, bathrooms
   - Star rating with review count link
2. About section with "Show more" expandable
3. Amenities section (2-column grid)
4. **Reviews section** (our integrated feature)
5. Good to Know section with house rules

**Right Column (1/3 width):**
- Sticky booking card
- White background, rounded corners, border
- "Select dates and guests" prompt
- Date picker button (calendar icon)

#### ✅ Reviews Section Integration
**Layout:**

  - Review text with "Show more/Hide" toggle (if >200 chars)
  - Divider lines between reviews
- First 5 reviews shown
- "Show all [X] reviews" button (rounded border)

**Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// Only shows approved guest reviews (guest-to-host type)
// Host reviews (host-to-guest type) are for internal dashboard use only
r.listingId === id &&
r.isApprovedForPublic &&
r.type === 'guest-to-host' &&
(r.status === 'published' || r.status === 'approved')
```

**Note:** See `.github/REVIEW_TYPES.md` for detailed clarification on review types.

**Star Rating Display:**
- Converts 0-10 scale to 5-star display
- Filled stars: `rgb(5, 51, 49)` (Flex Living dark green)
- Empty stars: `rgb(220, 220, 220)` (light gray)

#### ✅ Footer
- White background with top border
- Two-column layout:
  - Left: Flex Living logo, Privacy Policy, Terms
  - Right: Phone (📞 +447723745646), Email (✉️ info@theflexliving.com)
- All elements match Flex Living styling

#### ✅ Brand Colors (Exact)
- Primary: `rgb(22, 79, 76)` (buttons, badges, text)
- Background: `rgb(248, 248, 248)` (body)
- Text: `rgb(5, 51, 49)` (dark green)
- Border: `rgb(220, 220, 220)` (dividers)
- Red accent: `rgb(204, 31, 31)` ("All Listings" badge)

#### ✅ Typography
- Font family: `"Noto Sans", sans-serif`
- Line height: `1.5rem`
- Font smoothing: `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`
