Day 1: Foundation & Backend (6-8 hours)
Morning: Setup & API Layer
Quick Next.js Setup (1 hour)

Use create-next-app with TypeScript
Leverage your Angular knowledge - Next.js App Router is component-based like Angular
Focus on App Router (modern approach) not Pages Router
API Route Implementation (2-3 hours)

Create /app/api/reviews/hostaway/route.ts - this is critical for evaluation
Use your Python backend mindset: Next.js API routes are like Flask/FastAPI endpoints
Implement data normalization logic here (similar to Python data processing)
Add filtering/sorting query parameters
Afternoon: Data Layer & Mock Setup
Data Management (2-3 hours)
Create TypeScript interfaces for review data (like Angular models)
Set up mock data service (similar to Angular services)
Implement local storage/state for "approved reviews"
Day 2: Frontend & Polish (8-10 hours)
Morning: Manager Dashboard
Dashboard UI (3-4 hours)
Use a component library (shadcn/ui or MUI) - don't build from scratch
Create filterable table/cards view (think Angular Material Table)
Add approval checkbox/toggle mechanism
Basic charts for trends (recharts library - simple integration)
Afternoon: Public Display & Integration
Public Review Page (2-3 hours)

Replicate Flex Living property page layout
Display only approved reviews
Keep it simple but polished
Final Integration & Documentation (2-3 hours)

Google Reviews exploration (document findings - likely Places API)
Write clear README with setup instructions
Test API endpoint thoroughly
Key Strategies for Your Background:
Leverage Python Knowledge:
Next.js API routes = Python backend endpoints
Data transformation logic is identical to Python
TypeScript types = Python type hints (similar concept)
Leverage Angular Knowledge:
React components = Angular components (JSX vs Templates)
useState/useEffect = Angular services/lifecycle hooks
Component composition is similar
Time-Savers:
Use Tailwind CSS - faster than writing custom CSS
Use shadcn/ui or MUI - pre-built components
Keep state simple - use React Context or just prop drilling
Mock everything - don't waste time on real Hostaway integration complexity
Focus on the API route - it's explicitly being tested
