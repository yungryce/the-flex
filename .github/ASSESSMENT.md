1. Introduction
You are tasked with building a Reviews Dashboard for Flex Living. This tool will help managers assess how
each property is performing based on guest reviews.
2. Scope of Work
Scope of Work:

1. Hostaway Integration (Mocked)
- Integrate with the Hostaway Reviews API. Note: the API is sandboxed and contains no reviews.
- Use the provided JSON to mock realistic review data.
- Parse and normalize reviews by listing, review type, channel, and date.

2. Manager Dashboard
- Build a user-friendly, modern dashboard interface.
- The dashboard should allow managers to:
- See per-property performance
- Filter or sort by rating, category, channel, or time
- Spot trends or recurring issues
- Select which reviews should be displayed on the public website
- Use your judgment to design a clean and intuitive UI. Think like a product manager.

3. Review Display Page
- Replicate the Flex Living website property details layout.
- Add a dedicated section within that layout to display selected guest reviews.
- Reviews should be displayed only if approved/selected by the manager in the dashboard.
- Ensure the design is consistent with the Flex Living property page style.

4. Google Reviews (Exploration)
- Explore if Google Reviews can be integrated (via Places API or other).
- If feasible, implement basic integration.
- If not, include findings in your documentation.

3. Evaluation Criteria
Evaluation Criteria:

- Handling and normalization of real-world JSON review data
- Code clarity and structure
- UX/UI design quality and decision-making
- Insightfulness of the dashboard features
- Problem-solving initiative for undefined or ambiguous requirements
4. Deliverables
Deliverables:

- Source code (frontend and backend if applicable)
- Running version or local setup instructions
- Brief documentation (1-2 pages):
- Tech stack used
- Key design and logic decisions
- API behaviors
- Google Reviews findings (if any)
5. API Access
Account ID: 61148
API Key: f94377ebbbb479490bb3ec364649168dc443dda2e4830facaf5de2e74ccc9152
6. Important Notes
Access to sandbox Hostaway API will be provided.
Mock review data has been shared separately.

Important:
You must implement the API route that fetches and normalizes reviews (e.g. GET /api/reviews/hostaway).
This route will be tested and should return structured, usable data for the frontend.

Good luck and think like a product owner!
